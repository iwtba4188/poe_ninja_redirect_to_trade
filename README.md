# poe_ninja_redirect_to_trade

## Introduction
This is a simple Chrome extension designed to redirect character gear from poe.ninja to the official trade website.

## Getting Started
The extension is currently not available in the Chrome extension store. To install this Chrome extension, please use Developer Mode. You can Google the detailed method for installation.

## TODO
Currently, many modifiers still fail to correspond or are matched incorrectly. In the future, I will consider using a hash table or reverse matching to achieve a higher modifiers match rate.

## Note
To avoid numerous grammatical errors in my poor English, this README was translated using Copilot and manually corrected for inaccuracies.
